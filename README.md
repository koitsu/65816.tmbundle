65816.tmbundle
==============

This is a TextMate bundle for WDC's 65816 assembly language (Don't try it in Sublime Text unless you enjoy crashing).  Some effort is taken to be 
slightly intelligent about some opcode/operand pairs.

Currently supported:
* Generic 65816 (mnemonics only)
* ORCA/M Assembler
* MPW IIgs Assembler
* Merlin 8/16+ Assembler
* NinjaForce Assembler
